## The Project

Our app empowers individuals suffering from similar problems with the tools necessary to create their own support groups-- groups based on more than just their problems. It uses a short survey, categorizing the symptoms of an illness you have, and filters for individuals with similar symptoms as you. It then ranks them based on your matched interests using the Facebook API. The App infers interests based on page likes gathered from Facebook. We then analyze user page likes to infer their general interests using AWS comprehend topic classifier. Depending on the inferred interests, we suggest potential people that might best align with the user's interests/experiences.
